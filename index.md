I’m a **Linux System Administrator** with **9+ years of experience** working in **enterprise Data Centre environments** across the banking and telecom domains. My background includes managing **large-scale RHEL-based systems**, handling **24×7 operations**, and resolving **high-severity incidents** in SLA-driven environments.

I’m currently focused on **OpenShift administration** and certification preparation, and I created this platform to provide **hands-on, lab-oriented practice for the Red Hat DO280 OpenShift exam**.

Unlike theory-heavy notes, this site emphasizes:
